Carnallite - mineral with high contaiment of magnium. But here is the Language Server with ability to configure 
    almoast any behaviour aspect of runtime. It provides wide configuration of runtime and selected runtime tools.
    For frameworks with special support, like IntelliJ has additional support for Spring based application. You
    may achive that with plugins system that must appear at `1.0.0` release.

Language server implements default LSP protocol [specifications](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/)
    provided by Microsoft. I trying to also include the carnallite into modern text editors and IDEs with my forces.
    Possibly will add all of this in nearest releases.
